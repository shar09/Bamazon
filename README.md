# Bamazon

* Bamazon is Amazon-like storefront CLI App that lets customers to look at the available products and select the products that they like gives the total cost of the products.

* This App uses MySql and Nodejs to retrieve the data from database and display output on command line.

## Here's how the app works:
* When the app is run, information about all the available products like id, name, price, stock are shown.

* Then the user is prompted with two questions, 
  * The ID of the product of their choice.
  * The quantity of the product they would like to purchase.

* If there is enough stock of the selected product the user is shown the total cost of the purchase and database is         updated accordingly.

* Otherwise, the App displays 'Insufficient quantity' and the order is prevented from going through.
